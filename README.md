# Composite

A tiny entity-component-system library.

---

## Bugs

- In the canvas example, trying to `getComponent` on the first circle throws an exception (`column 1 is out of bounds`)

## TODO's

- [ ] Fix tests for `Archetype` instead of `Table` and delete `Table.hx`
- [ ] Try using it from a simple game like setting
- [ ] Try using it from Crafty
- [ ] Do some benchmarks

## Wishlist

- [ ] Event system for communication between query functions
- [ ] Handle queries for when components are added/changed/removed
